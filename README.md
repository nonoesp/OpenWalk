# OpenWalk

A plug-and-play open-source robot who can walk that works with Arduino.

## Usage

### Fabrication Drawings

OpenWalk is fabricated with informal fabrication materials and techniques. Really soon, we will make available the fabrication drawings with some instructions on how to assemble your own OpenWalk robot.

### Moving Algorithm

We are buildin a code so you can download and customize how the robot behaves. Keep tuned!
